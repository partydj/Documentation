Admins have all permissions, as well as being un-ban-able, able to delete rooms, privatise rooms, and change hosts.

BAs inherit from managers, and are global managers. They are able to do anything a manager can do, but in any room. They
are also un-ban-able by anyone except Admins, although there have been exploits around this.

Site Moderators inherit from bouncers, and are global bouncers.They are able to do anything a bouncer can do, but in any room. They
are also un-ban-able by anyone except Admins & BA's, although there have been exploits around this.

Plot and Promoters do not inherit any permissions. Although they have a color and a title in every room.
