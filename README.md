### The Community

You can join the [Party DJ Discord group here](https://discord.gg/SfSMHHX).

The aim of this is to help developers in a clean way, with how the API works, so that minimal harm can come to the
service of Party DJ. It is here to explain how things work so that developers need not test and consume resources of the
service. 

We are here to encourage best practices. Every effort should be taken to protect the users of Party DJ. Information 
posted should never encourage abusing the API, harming users with the collection of data, or spamming and/or causing
the site any harm
